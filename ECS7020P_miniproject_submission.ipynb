    "## What is the problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "This year's mini-project considers the problem of predicting whether a narrated story is true or not. Specifically, you will build a machine learning model that takes as an input an audio recording of **30 seconds** of duration and predicts whether the story being narrated is **true or not**. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Which dataset will I use?\n",
    "\n",
    "A total of 100 samples consisting of a complete audio recording, a *Language* attribute and a *Story Type* attribute have been made available for you to build your machine learning model. The audio recordings can be downloaded from:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://github.com/MLEndDatasets/Deception/tree/main/MLEndDD_stories_small\n",

    "## What will I submit?\n",
    "\n",
    "Your submission will consist of **one single Jupyter notebook** that should include:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Text cells**, describing in your own words, rigorously and concisely your approach, each implemented step and the results that you obtain,\n",
    "*   **Code cells**, implementing each step,\n",
    "*   **Output cells**, i.e. the output from each code cell,\n",
    "\n",
    "Your notebook **should have the structure** outlined below. Please make sure that you **run all the cells** and that the **output cells are saved** before submission. \n",

    "## How will my submission be evaluated?\n",
    "\n",
    "This submission is worth 16 marks. We will value:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Conciseness in your writing.\n",
    "*   Correctness in your methodology.\n",
    "*   Correctness in your analysis and conclusions.\n",
    "*   Completeness.\n",
    "*   Originality and efforts to try something new.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The final performance of your solutions will not influence your grade**. We will grade your understanding. If you have an good understanding, you will be using the right methodology, selecting the right approaches, assessing correctly the quality of your solutions, sometimes acknowledging that despite your attempts your solutions are not good enough, and critically reflecting on your work to suggest what you could have done differently. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that **the problem that we are intending to solve is very difficult**. Do not despair if you do not get good results, **difficulty is precisely what makes it interesting** and **worth trying**. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Show the world what you can do \n",
    "\n",
    "Why don't you use **GitHub** to manage your project? GitHub can be used as a presentation card that showcases what you have done and gives evidence of your data science skills, knowledge and experience. **Potential employers are always looking for this kind of evidence**. \n",
